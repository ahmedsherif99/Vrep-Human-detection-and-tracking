# Vrep-Human-detection-and-Tracking
This python code is used to detect virtual human in vrep simulation used for human tracking by a robot. This is done through a communication between vrep software and pycharm to run the python code.
The Vrep software code uses the python code to detect human then through the lua code it follows the human to keep track of him.
